    <div id="why"><p>This project was created by Neha Jonnakota, Cassandra Kaufman, Michelle Menard, Karla Ravin, and Nicole Rosas.
      We are part of <a target='_blank' href="https://girlswhocode.com/"> Girls Who Code</a>, located in Stamford, Connecticut.
      In this program, we learned many different coding languages and how to use them.
      We used the languages that we learned throughout this program, such Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, to create this website.
      This topic was of interest to us because we all have a passion to help others.</p>
</p>
    <p id="why"> Neha is a rising junior at Glastonbury High School, Glastonbury, CT who started <a target='_blank' href="http://www.powerofpeace.org/">her own nonprofit</a> that raises money for children in Connecticut and India.
        Casey is a rising junior at Byram Hills High School, Westchester, NY who started her own UNICEF organization in her town and is a volunteer swim instructor for underprivileged children.
        Michelle is a rising senior at Brien McMahon High School, Norwalk, CT who volunteers at her local church, in addition to being the president of the NAACP and BSU at her school.
        Karla is a rising junior at Stamford High School, Stamford, CT who volunteers with children at her library and annually participates in STEM Fest.
        Nicole is a rising junior at Choate Rosemary Hall, Wallingford, CT who volunteers at a local hospital, and reads to children at the library.
        We all really enjoy giving back to our communities, and had fun making this website in order to make volunteering more accessible to everyone. </p></div>
