      Volunteering is the most rewarding pastime you can take part in.
      However you choose to spend your time helps someone else, rather than being wasted by doing nothing.
      Through volunteering, you can learn how to lead and hold your ground.
      You learn how to have confidence in yourself and what you have to say.
      Volunteering is a way to show the world your passion and dedication.
      Everything you volunteer your precious time for is worth it.
      No matter how you volunteered your time, the end result always helps someone.
      Anyone who may be wondering whether to give up their time for “nothing” should know there’s always a reward.
      It most likely won’t be monetary, but maybe you’ll remember the beautiful smiling children you’ve helped, or the painting they’ve made of you.
